#Use this file to control which fields get loaded and which
#do not. Notice you must be licensed for the field in order
#to load it. Attempting to load a field that you are not
#licensed for will cause the server to fail on startup.
#The primary reason to turn a field off is to save memory.
#If you can load all your fields without memory issues, you
#should probably leave them all on.
#See the GeoDirectory documentation or contact support@quova.com
#for more help.
#Use 1 to turn the field on,  0 to turn it off.
